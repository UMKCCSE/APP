1.Introduction:
App store is an open source app for windows and android phone. We can use the same app for both the phones to download different apps. This reduces the time and expense associated with building and maintaining an app for each type of device.

2.Overall goal and objectives:
Goal
Our main goal is develop an app for different users with different O.S. and to notify them about the applications.

Objectives
We are designing a web application to enable the user to choose the apps of his interest and they can rate or review them. They can even know the details of the applications.
Significance 
We will work towards satisfying the user by notifying them about the applications that are of similar interests and they can even download them.

4.Proposed System:
Functional:
In our application an user with either android or windows phone can download apps. First the user needs to register in the sign up page if they want to download the apps. Guest users can only view the apps. This app will guide the user by suggesting good apps along with the reviews and ratings. Once the user logins the app store will show all the respective apps of their OS. User can search the apps based on the category like games, dictionary, music etc. On selecting the app, the user can view the description, reviews, rating and other suggested apps. User can download the app or view other apps to meet their requirements. The user will get notifications about recommended apps.
